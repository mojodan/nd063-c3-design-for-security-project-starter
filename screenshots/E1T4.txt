1. The S3 secret bucket shares the same API credentials as the S3 free recipe bucket.  This is not
a secure approach for protecting the secret recipes.  Access and management of this bucket
should be provided through an IAM Role and policy.

2.  The web service instance is in the public subnet and is exposed to port scans from all IP addresses.  
This should be moved to the private subnet and only accessible through the ALB.
